% Regret minimization using Regularized follow the leader algorithm

% define regret: sum of all losses from prediction minus sum of all losses
% when the true state was the worst for us
% r_t = sum(loss(prediction)) - minimum psi from C_n (sum(loss(measurement * psi)))

% Cn is the set of all trace-1 positive semi-definite complex matrices of
% dimension 2^n
